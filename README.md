## Use React and Next.js to set up React.js Environment
1. create a new package.json file with curly braces as content
2. Run "npm install react react-dom next" or "npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest" in the terminal. When the installation process is completed. you can view all dependent package information of the project in the package.json file.

    If package.json has many blank lines, execute "npm install"
3. Create a file named .gitgnore, and enter "node_modules" as the content. This will avoid uploading this folder to Git.
